## New words and phrases
1. as bad as you can go, you是虚指
2. maybe if you wrote it down为虚拟语气，完整说法为maybe if you wrote it down, you could show me his name，更加礼貌  
3. stand up to: to defend yourself against a powerful person or organization when they treat you unfairly:
	* He wasn't afraid to stand up to bullies.
    
## Notes  
口语中的一些连接词还是听不准，以及说快了一些词总是混淆。。。
