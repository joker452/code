## Dictation
The same common stones that ~~has grown~~ had gone in, through rubbing against each other like this, ~~producing~~ creating a little bit **of** fraction, ~~producing~~ creating a little bit **of** noise, ~~has~~ had come out these beautiful polished rocks. And that has always been in my mind, my metaphor for a team working really hard on something they are passionate about. ~~It…~~ is, is that, it is that through the team, through that group of ~~incredible~~ incredibly talented people, bumping up against each other, having arguments, having fights sometimes, making some noise. And working together, they polish each other. And they polish the ideas and what comes out ~~is~~ are these really beautiful stones. So, it’s hard to explain, uh, and it’s certainly not the result of one person. I mean, people like symbols so I’m the symbol of certain things, but it really **is- it** was a team effort on the Mac.
