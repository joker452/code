## Dictation  
So, ~~umm~~ um, I... I don't think *that* most of the really best people that I *'ve* worked with, have worked with computers for the sake of working with computers. They ~~work~~ *'ve worked* with ~~the~~ computers because they are the medium that is best capable of transmitting some feeling that you have, *that* you want to share with other people. Does that make any sense to you? Oh, ~~yhh~~ yeah. And, you know, before they invented these things, all these people would have done other, *other* things. But... but they... but computers were invented they did come along, and all these people did get interested it in *the- in- in* school or before school. And... and... and... and said, "Hey, this is the medium that I think I can say something in.", you know.
