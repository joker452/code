## Dictation  
~~And~~ But how do you know what's the right direction? You know, ultimately, it comes down to taste. It comes down to taste. It's... It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done. And then try to bring those things in to what you are doing. I mean, ~~Percasive~~ Picasso had ~~the~~ a saying~~. It said~~, he said "Good artists copy, great artists steal." And we have, uh, you know, always been ~~shamed~~ shameless about stealing great ideas. ~~Emm~~ Um, and I think part of what made the ~~Mactosh~~ Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, and poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians who also happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
## New words and phrases
1. come down to doing  
	* If a situation, problem, decision, etc comes down to something, then that is the thing that will influence it most.

## Notes  
这段不是很难，但是shameless居然听成shamed了。。。  
对完答案重听时发现，乔布斯发音时重音放在后面了。。。感觉是shamed+xxx，不过意思说不通。对于这种口语中的发音变化还是需要不断练习才能适应吧。
