## Dictation  
Uh, when we got into a factory in the Apple ~~Two~~ II days, ~~emm~~ um, the accounting ~~has~~ had this notion of a standard cost. Where you*'d* kind of set a standard cost and at the end of the quarter you*'d* adjust *it* with ~~the~~ a variance. And I kept asking ~~why do we do this.~~ "well, why do we do this?" And the answer was ~~that's just the way it's done~~ "Well, that's just the way it's done", and after about six months of digging into this what I realized was the reason you do it is because you don't really have good enough controls to know about how much it costs, so you guess, and you fix your guess at the end of the quarter. And the reason you don't know how much it costs is ~~just~~ because your information systems aren't good enough.

## Notes  
这一周没做毕设。今天从上午10点多开始做了一天，不过也没啥进展，虽然识别部分莫名其妙接近90了，但是老师又说要做敦煌，真心不会啊，后续看看怎么蒙混过关吧。。。  
'd仔细听是有的，自己听的时候没听出来，还是欠练。  
两个well很恶心，第一个完全听不出来，第二个反复听很不清楚，感觉就是中间稍微有一个空档，并没有听到well的音。
