## Notes  
英语学习中间间断了好几天，这两天还是坚持学下去，做做听写。  
are要仔细听才觉得有些像，但是也是很清楚。  
done it by the seat of you pants在the后面停顿了，这个词组不认识，认识也会因为停顿的位置也听不出来。  
How do听得也不是很清楚。
如果是how do you, 会读作[haʊ də ju]  
如果是how did you, 会读作[haʊ dɪ dʒu]  
如果how did you缩略为how'd you, 会读作[haʊ dʒu]  
I'd里'd是有的，但是也是不容易听出来。
I'll太快了...听不清  
感觉时态和连音、吞音是永远的难点啊。:dizzy_face:
