## Dictation  
I was keen to know about Steve's passion. What drove him? I read an article when I was very young in ~~Scientfics of America~~ Scientific American, and it.. it measured the efficiency of ~~local motion~~ locomotion for various species on the planet. So for, you know, bears, ~~champineezs~~ chimpanzees, ~~raccons~~ raccoons~~,~~ and birds and fish. How many kilo calories per kilometer ~~do~~ did they spend to move. And... and... and humans were measuerd, too. And the ~~corndor one~~ condor won. ~~it~~ It was the most efficient. And mankind, the ~~kind~~ crown of creation came in with a rather ~~unimpressively~~ unimpressive showing about ~~further~~ a third of the way down the list.

## Notes  
今天看了下笔记，发现已经一周多没做听写了。真是太不好了，学习英语是必须要坚持的一个事，而且也没有按照计划复习，之后一定注意。  
下周就要中期了，但是毕设非常不顺利，不知道要怎么测试，感觉结果根本不能看。希望之后能找到办法吧。。。ε=(´ο｀\*)))  
三个表示动物的单词都拼错了，说明自己现在基础的东西有些遗忘了。看来还是需要背一背单词。  
scientific american听的不是特别清楚，locomotion不认识，听起来和local motion极其相似，但是意思上确实说不通。
