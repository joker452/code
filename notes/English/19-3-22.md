And... and you might ask ~~us~~ : well, what's so interesting about that.

That was what we learned*,* was that*,* us, two, you know, we didn't know much. We could build a little thing that ~~can~~ could control a giant thing.

## Notes  
昨天心情很差，没什么理由，可能是太累了？？这次是记忆中这种情况下坚持学习最好的一次了。以前基本上就是放弃之后去看漫画、电影了，然后之后就会更闹心...感觉还是坚持一下事后心里会更好受，也确实对生活更有帮助。  
今天继续听写。  
ask: well真的是吞音太严重了，连在一起完全听不出来啊。  
box后面隐隐约约感觉有东西，一开始以为是boxes，但仔细听了之后觉得不像，但是也没听着像boxing，反复听觉得时有时无，不是很确定是box还是boxing。
