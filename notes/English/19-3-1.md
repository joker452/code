## Dictation  
So, how did you get involved, uh, with personal computers? ~~Emm~~Hmm. Well, ~~ahh~~um, I ran into my first computer when I was about ten or eleven. Emm, and it's hard to remember back then, but I'm, I'm a ~~fossile~~ fossil now, I'm ~~\*a \*little~~ an old 
~~fossile~~ fossil. So when I was ten or eleven, it was about thirty years ago. And, no one had ever seen a computer. To the extent~~,~~ that they ~~seeing~~ 'd seen them, they ~~seeing~~ 'd seen them in ~~the~~ movies and there were these big boxes with ~~\*vorrent~~ whirring. For some reason, they ~~fixed it~~ fixated on the tape drives as being the icon of what the computer was, *or*, or flashing lights somehow. 
## New words and phrases  
* fossil  
除了化石，一个非正式用法是过时的人（不愿意接受新想法或者改变），是贬义，但是听写里是自嘲。  
* whirring /wɜːr/  
to make a continuous low sound like the parts of a machine moving  
The clock began to whir before striking the hour.  
* fixate  
to make fixed, stationary, or unchanging  
积累一些英语表达  
* I just couldn't help it. 我就是忍不住。  
这句话十分的万能，可以用在茫茫多的场合。忍不住哭、笑、激动、兴奋、害怕等等等等，总之只要忍不住的情绪，一句couldn't help it就可以搞定。  
* Don't take it to heart. 别往心里去。
安慰人的黄金句子。  
* You bet. 好、行、没问题  
指自己没问题。举个例子 "You will be there on 9 p.m.?" "You bet."  
* Can you dig it? 你明白吗
* mashed /mæʃ/ potato 土豆泥  
* here or to go? 堂食还是带走  
* 买鞋 pig skin/ cow leather  
* sporting house 妓院

## Notes  
继续搞事情。  
an old辅元连读听不出来，看了答案之后感觉有些像an old但觉得也比较像a little。  
fossil拼错了，不开心。  
'd seen很难听出来，自己听的时候感觉seen很像seeing，但是语法不同，这种情况隐隐记得以前也有，以后希望通过语法能够排查出来。  
fixate这个太恶心了。。。不看答案我绝对人为是fix it。。。
