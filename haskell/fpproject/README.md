# Tiny Interpreter
This is the repository for final project of  Functional Programming course Spring 2019 at Tsinghua University.  
The specification for the interpreter and test cases can be found under the `doc` directory.  
Implementation is based on the provided framework code, mainly dependant on `StateT` MonadTransformer and `Map`.  
## How to run
change to the fpproject directory and type `stack build`.  
After successful build, use `stack test` to test the interpreter.  
## Feedback
Although the implementation passed all the tests provided, there may be bugs. Any feedback is welcome.
